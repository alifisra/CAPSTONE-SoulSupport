Machine Learning:
1. the steps in creating the chatbot feature begin with processing the dataset from Kaggle. 
2. Then from the dataset we translate it into Indonesian which is not standardized to make it easier for users to use our application.
3. After that, we tried to train data with accuracy reaching 94%.
4. Finally, make a model. In the process of making from start to finish we use python libraries and Pycharm tools.
